# NOYIS FOODS - Step 1 (Design & UI Skeleton)

This workspace contains the Step 1 skeleton for the NOYIS FOODS single-page app.

What this step includes:
- Fixed top header with burger menu and centered brand
- Side tray menu skeleton
- Centered Sales Form UI skeleton (no backend logic yet)
- Admin dashboard placeholder with stat cards and table placeholder
- Simple splash screen on initial load

How to run (after installing deps):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Next:
- Wait for your confirmation. After you approve Step 1 visuals and structure, I'll implement Step 2 (background animation).
